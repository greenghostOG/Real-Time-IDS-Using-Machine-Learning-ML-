# Real-Time-IDS-Using-Machine-Learning-ML-
This project implements a Real-Time Intrusion Detection System (IDS) powered by Machine Learning. It captures live network traffic, preprocesses it into features, and uses a trained ML model to detect whether packets are Normal or Malicious. The IDS provides real-time alerts in the console and also logs them into a file for further analysis.
